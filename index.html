        My Story Team is an application that allows users to create planners for
        their short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals. By using the app, users
        can organize their plans more effectively, track their progress, and
        stay motivated throughout the entire process. The application offers a
        clear and simple way to manage tasks and goals, making it easier and
        faster to turn plans into reality.

        People often have big life goals such as education, career, health, or personal development, but they frequently face the same challenges: they do not know where to start, they see their goals as too distant or unattainable, they lose motivation and give up, and they neglect basic habits such as sleep, health, and daily routines.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        This represents a significant social issue. When people fail to reach their full potential, levels of stress, anxiety, and burnout increase. More and more young people give up on education, work, or personal ambitions, and society gradually loses productive, healthy, and motivated individuals.

        To address this problem, the planner is based on a circle system.
Each circle represents a different level of importance and time scale:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ol class=".List1">
        <li>the smallest circle represents daily plans</li>
        <li>the medium circle represents short-term goals (from the current month up to, for example, the end of the year)</li>
        <li>the largest circle represents long-term goals that span several years, such as enrolling in university</li>
      </ol>
