          My Story Team is an application that allows users to create planners
          for their short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals. By using the app,
          users can organize their plans more effectively, track their progress,
          and stay motivated throughout the entire process. The application
          offers a clear and simple way to manage tasks and goals, making it
          easier and faster to turn plans into reality.

        <p>
          People often have big life goals such as education, career, health, or
          personal development, but they frequently face the same challenges:
          they do not know where to start, they see their goals as too distant
          or unattainable, they lose motivation and give up, and they neglect
          basic habits such as sleep, health, and daily routines.
          <br />This represents a significant social issue. When people fail to
          reach their full potential, levels of stress, anxiety, and burnout
          increase. More and more young people give up on education, work, or
          personal ambitions, and society gradually loses productive, healthy,
          and motivated individuals.

            >To address this problem, the planner is based on a circle system.
            Each circle represents a different level of importance and time
            scale:</b

        <ol class="List1">
          <li>the smallest circle represents daily plans</li>
          <li>
            the medium circle represents short-term goals (from the current
            month up to, for example, the end of the year)
          </li>
          <li>
            the largest circle represents long-term goals that span several
            years, such as enrolling in university
          </li>
